        <p>The Joy Applied Research Center in Information Techonology provide equipment access and other technical support for studies in science and engineering across the University in its Core Laboratories. The labs are located in Joe Mack Wilson Student Center. </p>
        <p>Support includes access to laboratory and research equipment, asset management services, surface analysis and advanced characterization of materials. We have expertise in the use of light, plasma, and directed energy in material processing for nanoscale thin-film coatings and device development, and in the use of contact and non-contact mechanical properties and imaging of cell systems, biomimetic, and other soft materials. JCARIT supports statewide economic development as a member of a core laboratory resource sharing agreement among Georgia research institutions.</p>
